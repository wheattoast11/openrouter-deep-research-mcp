**Phase 1: Beta Release** (Recommended)
```bash
1. Create branch: release/v2.0.0-beta
2. Push to GitHub
3. Publish to npm with beta tag
4. Gather feedback for 1-2 weeks
5. Address any issues → v2.0.1-beta
6. Promote to stable when validated
```

## 🎓 What Users Should Know

### For Existing v1.6 Users

**No Action Required**: v2.0 is 100% backward compatible
- All v1.6 code works unchanged
- All v1.6 tools available (set `MODE=ALL` if needed)
- All v1.6 optimizations retained

**Optional Enhancements**: Try new features gradually
- Week 1: Use magic prompts
- Week 2: Query knowledge graph
- Week 3: Add WebSocket client
- Week 4: Set up scheduled actions

### For New Users

- Use `MODE=AGENT` (default)
- Connect via WebSocket for bidirectional features
- Try magic prompts for common workflows
- Let knowledge graph accumulate automatically
- Set up scheduled monitoring for key topics

## 🔍 Key Differentiators

### What Makes v2.0 a "Step-Change"

1. **Intelligence as a Two-Way Street**
   - Not just "you ask, it answers"
   - Agent can ask, suggest, notify proactively
   - Real-time steering and context provision

2. **Continuous Operation, Not Just On-Demand**
   - Agent operates on a timeline (cron)
   - Monitors topics continuously
   - Proactive briefings and alerts

3. **Persistent, Evolving Memory**
   - Knowledge graph grows with every interaction
   - Entities and relationships extracted automatically
   - Better answers over time as knowledge accumulates

4. **Simplicity Through Intelligence**
   - Complex workflows become one-liners (magic prompts)
   - Auto-routing based on context
   - Unified retrieval across multiple sources

5. **Event-Driven, Not Poll-Driven**
   - Subscribe to resources for reactive UIs
   - WebSocket for instant updates
   - No more polling for job status

## 🎉 Conclusion

v2.0 represents a **complete transformation** of the OpenRouter Agents platform:

- From **reactive** to **proactive**
- From **stateless** to **stateful with memory**
- From **request-response** to **continuous partnership**
- From **complex** to **"magic"**

All while maintaining **100% backward compatibility** and providing **multiple integration patterns** for gradual adoption.
